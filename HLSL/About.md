<h2 align="center">Unity HLSL</h2>

### Also see [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/writing-shader-writing-shader-programs-hlsl.html) on this topic  

Unity writes GPU side code in **HLSL (High Level Shading Language)**, which is very similar to GLSL, but more advanced. In general code in this language describes how the GPU should process your data

In [Native](./Native/About.md) section you can find information about HLSL basic data types, functions and syntax
This info is also available on [Microsoft website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-reference).

But we cannot just end here as, obviously, Unity has a large shader base with its own global variables, structures and methods and other hairy things, which, unfortunately, is very poorly documented. To make things clearer and easier to find, all these topic are covered in [Unity URP](./Unity/About.md) section.
