# HLSL-U-Docs
This repository was created for educational purposes, is NOT official and is community driven.
All URP code belongs to [Unity Technologies](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics) and is referenced appropriately. Repository's main target is to provide a reference base for ShaderLab and HLSL for **Unity's Universal Rendering Pipeline**. (Built-In and HDRP might be added in the future)

Contributions are very welcome! If you wish to contribute please see [Contribution]() page.


## Why?
If you once looked into Unity's ShaderLab or HLSL documentation it almost surely raised a lot of questions such as
- "Do I have to do it manually or does Unity provide tools for this"?
- "Floats are easy to declare, but how do I declare a default texture?"
- "`#pragma fragment`? `#pragma multi_compile`? Whats the difference? Which keywords can I use?"
- "Can I include other files in the shader? Where can I get Unity's HLSL source code?"
- "Are there variables that are reserved for Unity? How can I utilize them?" 

Many of these and other issues and hidden tricks will be explorred here.
## What you can find here
