# HLSL-U-Docs
This repository is NOT official and is community driven. Contributions are very welcome! If you wish to contribute please see [reference]

## Why?
If you once looked into Unity's ShaderLab/HLSL/ documentation it almost surely raised a lot of questions   
- "Floats are easy to declare, but how do I declare a default texture?"
- "
```#pragma fragment```?
```#pragma multi_compile```?
Whats the difference? Which keywords can I use?"
- "Can I include other files into shader? Where can I get Unity's HLSL source code?"
- "Are there variables that are reserved for Unity? How can I utilize them?"
