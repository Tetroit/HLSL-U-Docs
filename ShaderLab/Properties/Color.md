<h2 align = "center">Color property</h2>

Defines a color
### Syntax
```C#
_VarName ("InspectorName", Color) = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
//or
_VarName ("InspectorName", Color) = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

Same as [**Vector**](./Vector.md), but is displayed as color picker in the editor.  
Default value is given as a 3-component (without alpha, alpha defaults to ```1.0```) or with 4-component (with alpha) set of floats between round brackets.
