<h2 align="center">Shader programming tutorial</h2>

Prerequisites:

- Unity
- Basic understanding of data oriented programming
- Bonus: previous experience with shaders, c++ or graphic APIs

This section contains a step-by-step tutorial about shader programming using URP. Since shaders have no limits, this tutorial is general purpose and will cover the creation of a custom lit shader (looks just like Unity's one). This way it is easier to understand the workflow and get a fascinating result, which is amazingly simple using URP toolset!
